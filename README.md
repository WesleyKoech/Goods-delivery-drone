# Goods-delivery-drone
This project forms part of my final year in campus. In recent years the rise in need for unmanned aerial vehicles also known as drones cannot be overemphasized. This has been attributed to the need for timely delivery of goods and services to customers, timely delivery of rescue equipment to inaccessible areas faced by catastrophe such as flood, earthquake, fire etc., supply of blood and medical equipment to remote hospitals and need for aerial surveillance during combat operations. Recently, a lot of research has been carried out on rotatory drones. However, this type of drones has a number of drawbacks which include very short time and can carry a lower payload. Therefore, such kinds of drones cannot meet the market demand. The aim of this project is to design, implement and test a fixed wing drone model. A fixed wing drone has a number of advantages which include a long time of flight at low power demand and can carry a large payload. We intend to build a fixed wing drone which can easily take off within a few meters on a slab, can be controlled by a pilot on ground, maneuverable and can land safely. In addition, the drone will be interfaced with GPS (Global positioning system). This will allow the drone to fly autonomously under the guidance of the GPS.
